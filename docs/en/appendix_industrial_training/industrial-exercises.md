# C.4 Industrial Practice Exercises

This page does not present exercises as abstract algorithm puzzles. Instead, it works backwards from real job requirements: what post-training and RL roles actually do day to day, and what kind of projects convincingly demonstrate competence.

The examples here were distilled from public job postings around May 2026. Job descriptions change, so do not memorize company names. Focus on the stable capabilities behind the roles: data, training, reward, evaluation, systems, and the product feedback loop.

## One-Sentence Summary

Industrial post-training/RL roles usually do not end at "knowing PPO formulas." They expect you to deliver outcomes like:

- rewrite a business problem into trainable and measurable model-behavior targets,
- build SFT, preference, reward, RLVR, or agent-trajectory datasets,
- choose among SFT, DPO, RM, PPO, GRPO, RLOO, RLVR, and explain why,
- run stable training while monitoring KL, entropy, reward, pass rate, length, throughput, and regressions,
- diagnose reward hacking, capability regressions, data contamination, evaluation distortion, and slowdowns,
- translate model improvements into product metrics, UX, safety/compliance, or real-environment task success.

The key point: post-training roles center around "improving language-model behaviors," while classic RL roles center around "policies acting in environments." In the LLM era, the two overlap heavily in agents, tool use, code, math, robotics, and autonomy.

## How to Interpret Regional Differences

**China roles: more emphasis on business deployment and data flywheels.**

Common keywords in public postings include "application scenarios," "vertical domains," "data synthesis," "online feedback," "evaluation systems," "training efficiency," and "real user experience." This means you cannot just show an open-source benchmark score; you must also explain: where user problems come from, how badcases enter the data pool, how SFT/preference/RL data are mixed, and how you prove business experience improved after training.

**US roles: more emphasis on frontier post-training and large-scale systems.**

Roles at OpenAI, Anthropic, and similar companies place post-training as the critical step before releasing final product models. Common tasks include eval, graders, reward models, RL systems, agentic models, tool use, code capabilities, and training pipeline stability. Candidates must be able to switch between research, engineering, and product boundaries.

**EU roles: more emphasis on research platforms, enterprise scenarios, and embodied/autonomous systems.**

European LLM companies handle enterprise customization, research platforms, HPC, evaluation, and compliance constraints; at the same time, RL roles in robotics, autonomous driving, and defense autonomous systems emphasize simulation, real-world systems, safety boundaries, and engineering verification. When practicing, do not only work on chat models — keep at least one "environment-interactive RL" project.

## Real Work Breakdown

### 1. Post-Training Algorithm Engineer

What you actually do:

- Translate product problems into training objectives. For example, "more helpful answers" must be decomposed into factuality, coverage, structure, refusal boundaries, and citation quality.
- Build SFT data, preference data, reward data, RL prompt pools, and regression evaluation sets.
- Choose among SFT, DPO, RM+PPO, GRPO, RLVR, or mixed losses, and explain compute, data, and risk tradeoffs.
- Run training and monitor loss, reward, KL, entropy, length, repetition rate, refusal rate, pass rate.
- Analyze badcases, determining whether the problem comes from data, rewards, sampling, training hyperparameters, prompt templates, or evaluation.

Practice:

- Pick a vertical domain — legal, education, financial research, code assistant, or enterprise customer service — and build 500 SFT examples, 200 preference pairs, and 100 regression tests.
- Run LoRA SFT on a 1B/3B/7B open-source model, then do one round of DPO or ORPO preference optimization.
- Write a training report: data sources, filtering rules, training configs, metric changes, badcases, next-round data plan.

### 2. Reward Model / Judge / Grader Engineer

What you actually do:

- Define what a "good answer" means, decomposing vague preferences into rubrics.
- Design hybrid scoring schemes: human annotation, synthetic preferences, LLM-as-judge, rule verifiers.
- Train or calibrate a reward model, checking whether it favors verbosity, boilerplate, excessive refusals, or fixed formats.
- Provide stable rewards for RL training and continuously monitor reward hacking.

Practice:

- Build a math or code verifier: correct answer gives main reward; format, length, execution safety give auxiliary rewards.
- Build an LLM-as-judge rubric: factuality, instruction following, completeness, safety each scored 1-5, with spot-checks for judge-human annotation consistency.
- Construct 50 counterexamples of "looks polite but contains no information" and test whether the reward model is fooled.

### 3. RL / GRPO / RLVR Training Engineer

What you actually do:

- Design verifiable rewards for math, code, tool calling, or agent tasks.
- Control on-policy data, sampling group size, KL penalty, advantage normalization, training batch, and rollout batch.
- Diagnose reward increasing while real metrics declining, KL spiking, entropy collapse, outputs getting longer or shorter.
- Achieve stable training with limited compute, not just one-time high scores.

Practice:

- Set up an RLVR training on GSM8K, MATH subset, or HumanEval subset: sample 4-8 responses per prompt, use rules or execution results for reward.
- Compare three configurations: low KL, medium KL, high KL; plot reward, pass rate, KL, entropy, average output length.
- Write a one-page incident postmortem: if reward rises but pass@1 drops, how do you diagnose and roll back.

### 4. Agentic Post-Training Engineer

What you actually do:

- Build tool-calling environments: browser, code executor, file system, database, API.
- Record complete trajectories: observation, action, tool call, tool result, reward, failure reason.
- Design graders that judge whether tasks are truly completed, not just whether final text looks polished.
- Teach the model multi-turn planning, function calling, error recovery, and termination.

Practice:

- Build a small coding agent training environment: input issue, model modifies code, runs tests, reward for passing tests.
- Create 30 web/file operation tasks, record trajectories and write graders — e.g., "find price and fill in form," "fix a failing test."
- For each failed trajectory, annotate failure type: didn't understand task, wrong tool-call parameters, couldn't recover, stopped early, hallucinated file path.

### 5. RL Systems / Training Infrastructure Engineer

What you actually do:

- Optimize throughput of rollout, reward, training, buffer, and weight sync.
- Handle policy version, staleness, long-tail completions, GPU utilization, failure retries.
- Build training health checks so errors surface on small clusters first, rather than discovering a large training run is broken days later.
- Support new algorithm integration while maintaining stability, speed, and reproducibility.

Practice:

- Write a simplified rollout buffer: record prompt, response, reward, old logprob, policy_version.
- Simulate asynchronous training: have rollout workers generate data using stale policies, observe staleness impact on metrics.
- Add 10 monitoring metrics to a training script: tokens/s, samples/s, reward latency, KL, entropy, OOM count, retry count, queue length, policy lag, eval regression.

### 6. Robotics / Autonomous Driving / Autonomous Systems RL Engineer

What you actually do:

- Model tasks as MDPs: states, actions, rewards, termination conditions, constraints.
- Train policies in simulation, then analyze the sim-to-real gap.
- Do safety evaluation: collision, boundary violations, energy consumption, comfort, robustness, extreme scenarios.
- Debug collaboratively with perception, control, simulation, and hardware teams.

Practice:

- Build a continuous control task with Gymnasium, MuJoCo, Isaac Gym, or PyBullet, comparing PPO and SAC.
- Design three versions of reward: task success only, adding energy constraints, adding safety constraints; observe policy differences.
- Write a sim-to-real risk checklist: sensor noise, latency, dynamics errors, actuator limits, environment distribution shift.

Deliverable: project plan, environments, graders, evaluation gates, and a risk-and-mitigation list.

## How to Present Projects in Interviews

A convincing project is not "I ran a framework." It should clearly answer five questions:

1. **Goal**: what behavior you improve, and why it matters.
2. **Data**: where data comes from, how it is cleaned and mixed, and how leakage is prevented.
3. **Training**: why this algorithm, what key hyperparameters are, and how stability is ensured.
4. **Evaluation**: how offline metrics, human eval, regression tests, and product metrics cross-validate.
5. **Postmortem**: where it failed, how badcases were attributed, and what you changed next.

If you are targeting China post-training roles, prioritize showing "domain data + post-training + evaluation + product feedback loop." If you are targeting US frontier post-training/RL roles, prioritize showing "training systems + eval/graders + agentic RL + large-scale experiment habits." If you are targeting EU roles, prioritize showing "research engineering capability + enterprise/physical/robotics scenarios + HPC/compliance/safety verification."
