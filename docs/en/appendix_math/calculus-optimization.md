# D.3 Calculus and Optimization

Training a reinforcement learning agent is, at its core, a matter of adjusting parameters: making the average return higher and higher, or making prediction error smaller and smaller. The underlying language for this process is calculus. Derivatives tell us "which way to move", gradients tell us "how each parameter should move", and the chain rule lets that signal travel backward through the entire computation graph.

This section follows that thread. We start from functions and rates of change, move step by step to derivatives, gradients, and the chain rule, then see how these tools appear in policy gradients, Taylor approximations, PPO clipping, and GRPO normalization.
