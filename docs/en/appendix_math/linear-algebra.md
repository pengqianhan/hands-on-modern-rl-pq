# D.1 Mathematical Objects and Linear Algebra

Chapter 3 introduced the Bellman equation $V(s) = R(s) + \gamma\sum_{s'}P(s'|s,a)V(s')$, which describes the value of a single state. In actual computation, however, three problems appear in sequence: how to express the equations for all states at once, how to approximate values when the state space is too large, and how to keep the iterative process stable. Module D.1 shows the linear algebra tools that answer each problem and how those tools build on one another.
